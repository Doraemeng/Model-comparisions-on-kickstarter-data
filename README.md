# Model-comparisions-on-kickstarter-data

This project is to study the data of the kickstarter projects, 
tryint to help upcoming entrepreneurs make better plans on kickstarter to improve their rates of success.

Three models are build on the kickstarter data set. Random forest, KNN, Neural network. The three models are compared based on 
accuracy of their fit to the data. We find three models produce similar result. KNN works a little better.
